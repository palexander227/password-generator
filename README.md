# Project Title

This project is in partial fulfillment with the UC Berkeley Extension programming project --- construct a password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

So we call this project Password Generator ...

## Getting Started

This is a stand alone application and should work once you hit the "Generate Password" button from within the page file:///C:/Users/renor/Desktop/03-javascript/homework/Develop/index.html

On that link, you can play around with how the app works. 

Here is a video of me demoing the whole thing if you want to kick back and watch TV https://www.loom.com/share/0f35fe98430d41cda138aecc2857d35b

### Prerequisites

No prereq's to use ... but maybe a bit to evaluate?

Note this user is not free to enter garbage and the code moves through ... the user either MUST enter a valid password length and valid choice selection, or they are given the option to opt out.



### Installing

Please let me know if you are interested in the code for this. I feature several "while" loops which serve to keep the user engaged if they really are intentional about generating a password.

For the record:

Requirements are:

1) enter a real integer greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 128. If you do not do this, my algorithm will bounce you all over the place until you enter valid input or give up. NO APOLOGIES!
2) once agreed on a real integer length, you must specify at least one of four potential defining criteria of this alorithm's inclusion criteria. If you don't, you are sent into a loop until you either opt out, or cave! " ... go with the logic Spock ...".
3) done? you get your password ...
